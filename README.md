# SIT313-Project-One
Android project development work
In this readme file, I'd like to introduce my plan and what am i learn. 
In fact, every week I would spent harf or one hour to design and development my project. 
Utill now, I achieve my project-one, but it is not good enough. 
In my project one, I create two different activities, and in the video, I am showing the relationship bettween the main activity and other activity.
becasuse the reason of the time is not enough, I just develop my project-one by during two week, and I am busy with my other Units, so my project-one only ensure the some basic functions.
So, for next the step, I will make sure my project can contain more functions.
